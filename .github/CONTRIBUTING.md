# Contributing to Retour

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

There are a few ways how you can contribute to the development of Retour:

### Report issues & suggest features 
It's already a huge help to receive detailed bug reports and thought-through feature requests. You can submit any of these by [creating a new issue](https://github.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/issues/new) and using the issue templates, which are set up to guide you through providing all information that will help working on these.

### Translate Retour
Retour is designed to present its UI in the language the current Panel user has selected for the UI. But of course for that, it needs to bundle translations for all text in the UI. We already have some translations provided and maintained by the community, but, of course, the more the merrier.

If you would like to contribute, please head over to [Transifex](http://transifex.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/) where all our translating for Retour is done.

### Donate

Retour is offered for free under the MIT license. If you still would like to support the development, I appreciate [any contribution](https://paypal.me/distantnative).
