## Redirects

### URL pattern
Path to catch via the plugin and redirect. Can use routing patterns, e.g. `(:any)` or `(:all)`, [learn more](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/router/patterns).

### Redirect to
Four options:
- Relative path inside your own site (e.g. `blog/2018/a-nice-story`)
- URL of external website (e.g. `https://getkirby.com`)
- `error` to return your site's error page
- empty to let the browser request fail (for status codes not in the `3xx` range)

If you use routing patterns, the mathed parts can be used via numbered variables (`$1`, `$2`...): e.g. `project/$1/gallery`

### Status
Status codes in the `3xx` range will actually redirect the request to the new location (URL changes). All other HTTP status codes have the option to return a specified page with the selected HTTP status code (while the URL stays the same) or let the browser request fail with the selected HTTP status code (if you leave the `Redirect to` field empty).

**Color of the status bubbles**
- ![#7ea328](https://via.placeholder.com/16.png/7ea328?text=+) Redirects (`300`-`399`)
- ![#f0c674](https://via.placeholder.com/16.png/f0c674?text=+) Other HTTP status codes
- ![#c82829](https://via.placeholder.com/16.png/c82829?text=+) `disabled`

**HTTP status codes**
https://httpstatuses.com

## Tracking

Retour tries to track the times it redirects visitors as well as the times visitors try to visit a page on your site that does not exist (typically when they get a `404` error or your site's error page shown).

To maintain privacy and collect the least data necessary, Reroute does not log any personal data of the visitor (no IP etc.). Only the target URL, the referrer and the time are stored in an agregated way.

The tracked hits are displayed in the Panel with a blue status bublle, indicating whether a redirect route or `404` path has been visited ![#4271ae](https://via.placeholder.com/14.png/4271ae?text=+) recently or ![#ccc](https://via.placeholder.com/14.png/ccc?text=+) not so recently.
