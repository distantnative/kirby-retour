## Installation + updates

[Download](https://github.com/distantnative/retour-for-kirby/archive/master.zip), unzip and copy this repository to `/site/plugins/retour`.

Alternatively, you can install it with composer:
```bash
composer require distantnative/retour-for-kirby
```

For updates, make a backup of your redirects and log files (`/site/config/redirects.yml` and `/site/logs/retour.sqlite`) and replace the whole `/site/plugins/retour` folder.

## What is it about?

### Redirects

**URL pattern**  
Path to catch via the plugin and redirect. Can use routing patterns, e.g. `(:any)` or `(:all)`, [learn more](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/router/patterns).

Please notice that you can only create redirects for paths where no actual page exists. Existing pages or routes will always overrule redirects set up in Retour.

**Redirect to**  
- Relative path inside your own site (e.g. `blog/2018/a-nice-story`)
- URL of external website (e.g. `https://getkirby.com`)
- `error` to return your site's error page
- empty to let the browser request fail (for status codes not in the `3xx` range)

If you use routing patterns, the matched parts can be used via numbered variables (`$1`, `$2`...): e.g. `project/(:any)/photos` => `project/$1/gallery`.

**Status**  
[HTTP status codes](https://httpstatuses.com) in the `3xx` range will actually redirect the request to the new location (URL changes). All other HTTP status codes have the option to return a specified page with the selected HTTP status code (while the URL stays the same) or let the browser request fail with the selected HTTP status code (if you leave the `Redirect to` field empty).

- ![#f0c674](https://via.placeholder.com/16.png/f0c674?text=+) Other HTTP status codes
